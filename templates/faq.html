              As defined by UNICEF, Career Counselling / Career Guidance is a
              comprehensive, right-based development approach which is designed
              to assist individuals in making and implementing informed
              educational and occupational choices, which in turn lead to their
              social, financial and emotional well-being. Career Guidance is a
              process by which an adolescent makes a successful transition from
              school to higher education and finally into the workforce. The
              process involves exploring different careers, knowing the
              different pathways to careers, opportunities available, earning
              levels, and the time period required. Further it involves knowing
              one’s strengths and interest, matchmaking one’s own potential to
              the world of careers and then selecting the right courses and
              colleges, the process to apply and finally the ways to finance
              his/her education. iDreamCareer has a team of more than 898
